					<h1>Inclusive storytelling with (dynamic!) data</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Hi everyone, my name is Larene Le Gassick. It's so wonderful to be here in Perth. I usually live and work in Meanjin or the lands of the Turrbul and Jagera peoples, also known as Brisbane. And I pay my respects to their elders, past and present, as well as those of Noongar peoples of Whadjuk (Perth), and to all the elders of communities of anyone travelling or watching online today.

						I am a software engineer and I work at a company called Intopia. We are a digital accessibility consultancy. If you end up enjoying this talk and would like to talk about accessibility at work all day, please do consider checking out our "Work with us" page. We work with some pretty hecticly cool people and companies who are passionate about making sure their software is accessible, in fact some of you may have worked with us before. If you don't end up enjoying this talk, but would still like to talk about accessibility all day, then please do still consider joining and I'll promise not to give anymore talks.

					<h2>The story behind this talk</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						I did a talk in February of 2020 at the Brisbane Data Science Meetup, one of my favourite people and meetups (hi Enrique, if you're watching!). I also gave a version of a talk with a speed graph re-design - it's admitted not the most accessible talk I've given, a very visual-only talk, but it does cover a lot of dataviz accessibility basics, and I recommend you watch it after this talk. It was a talk called "Inclusive storytelling with data", this talk is a reprise of that, with a dynamic spin.

						The original talk was very  much inspired by a book titled "Storytelling with data" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, who spent much of their career at Google, teaching people how to communicate better with data.

					<aside class="notes">
						If you want to make accessible data visualisations, you will first need to learn a little bit about design! A well-designed data visualisation is easy to interpret and understand. Good design takes into account the needs of the users, and some of those users will have disabilities. Inclusive design is the key to good design, and considers disability, language, culture, gender, age, and other forms of human difference.

A permanent motor disability is missing an arm, while a temporary motor disability is having a broken arm, and a situational disability is a parent carrying a newborn. Each cell contains a minimalist vector illustration representing each example of a permanent, temporary, or situational disability example for each disability category.

					<aside class="notes">
						There is now a very often shared diagram about inclusive design, you may have seen it or known it before. It's a table with 3 columns and 4 rows. The columns refer to examples of Permanent, Temporary, and Situational disability, and the rows refer to senses such as Motor, Vision, Hearing, and Speech. A permanent motor disability is missing an arm, while a temporary motor disability is having a broken arm, and a situational disability is a parent carrying a newborn. You can come up with your own examples for the others. The goal of this graphic is to illustrate that if disability is viewed as a mismatch between a person and their environment, designing for disability actually benefits everyone. So, designing a chart accessibly, will help your dataviz be understood by more people!

					<aside class="notes">
						When I first gave this talk, I only covered how to make images of graphs more accessible. But since then, dynamic, or programmatic data visualisations have become more popular, especially with the beginning of COVID and the US election happening at the same time. Interactive graphs and election maps were everywhere!

						Unfortunately, not many of these HTML graphs were accessible. And by that I mean, apart from colour contrast issues, or a lack of a descriptive title and axes - they generally didn't work with a keyboard, and they absolutely didn't work with a screen reader. Important health and political information was exclusively for sighted people who could use a mouse.

						Here is an example of one of the most famous interactive data visualisations for the US election in 2020.

					<h2>What do you need to do to make an accessible HTML chart?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Use <a href="https://www.highcharts.com">Highcharts</a>.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						That is not very useful information!

						So, how do we make an accessible HTML chart?

						Luckily, in the last few years, one particular company has made it very easy.

						Use the High Charts Javascript Charting library, include the recommended accessibility modules, and off you go!

						Thanks for coming to my talk.

						Jokes aside, unless you have a giant development team, you probably don't want be writing your own dataviz library, especially if you want it to be accessible. High Charts isn't the only library out there, but it is one of the most fully featured, and constantly improving.

					<aside class="notes">
						A few years ago, I built a dynamic chart when I worked for a logging company, to show how effective the log retention policies were on keeping the disk space maintainable. It was a bar chart that ended up keyboard accessible, using d3.js. It was also designed to be screen reader accessible, but it is probably a horrendous experience for them, with a lot of repetition, and sadly it wasn't tested with real screen reader users.

					<aside class="notes">
						So, let's make a graph! But first, let's talk about graphs that are images - how do we make these accessible?

						If your graph is just an image, there are a few steps to make it accessible. Testing the contrast of elements, making sure title and labels are there, and making sure there is appropriate alternative text. Generally a static image of a chart exists to support a fact or conclusion in the surrounding text. Luckily, a dataviz specialist Amy Cesal wrote a deceptively simple template to help you write alternative text for your images of charts!

					<h2>Quick checklist of checks</h2>

					<h2>Practice adding alt text to your #DDDPerth tweets!</h2>
					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						For those who don't know, adding alternative text allows people who use screen readers to understand what is in an image. If you are tweeting today, please make sure you add alt text to your tweets, or LinkedIn posts, so that low vision or other people who use screen readers can participate as well. It's not easy if you're not used to it, but please try! You can now check out what alt-text other conference go-ers are adding, to help you learn about what to write. Or, feel free to take a look through my Twitter account.

					<h2>How to make accessible HTML charts</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Back to dataviz. So, what if we need to create a chart that works with changing data? For example, most people here probably have a banking or other finance app, either on their phone, or via a web browser. Have you thought about the HTML and JS used to build it?

					<h2>Start with a table of data</h2>
					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th scope="col">Month</th>
								<th scope="col">Incoming</th>
								<th scope="col">Outgoing</th>

						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<th scope="row">Jul 2022</th>
								<td class="currency">$1,293</td>

					<aside class="notes">
						Usually, we start with a table of data, it's usually in a spreadsheet - which is handy! You should keep this around, we'll use it later. Actually, this is a good time to ask - do we really need a chart for this? Can it just be a table? If the answer is yes, all you need to do is to make sure the table uses the correct semantic HTML, so that the screen reader experience is good, and voila - an accessible, dynamic dataviz!
